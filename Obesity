The business problem for this analysis could be developing a prediction model to identify individuals at risk of obesity based on their 
characteristics and behaviors. This could be useful for healthcare providers, insurers, and public health organizations to target 
interventions and support for individuals who are likely to develop obesity or are already overweight. By predicting obesity levels, healthcare 
providers can offer personalized treatment plans and interventions to prevent or manage obesity-related health issues. Insurers can use this 
information to offer tailored wellness programs and incentives to encourage healthy behaviors. Public health organizations can use this data to 
understand trends in obesity and develop targeted interventions to address the problem at a population level. 
Ultimately, the goal of this analysis would be to improve individual health outcomes and reduce the overall burden of obesity on society.

Questions for this analysis:
1.Can we predict the likelihood of obesity based on variables such as family history with overweight, high caloric food consumption, and 
physical activity level?
2. How does gender impact obesity levels in individuals?
3. Are there any relationships between eating habits (such as main meals daily, vegetable consumption, and snacking between meals) and obesity levels?
4. Can we classify individuals into different obesity levels based on their demographic and lifestyle factors?
5.Is there a correlation between alcohol consumption and obesity levels?
6.How do factors like smoking, daily water intake, and use of tech devices impact obesity levels?
7.Can we predict the risk of obesity based on a combination of variables such as transportation mode used, monitor calories, and physical activity 
level?*/

 CONCLUSION:

The analysis revealed several key findings:

Gender, age, eating vegetables, main meals daily, physical activity, tech device time, monitoring calories, transportation used, weight, and drinking alcohol were significant 
predictors of obesity levels.
Lifestyle factors such as eating between meals, monitoring calories, transportation mode, weight, and age were strongly associated with obesity levels.
Female gender, older age, higher weight, lower frequency of eating vegetables, fewer main meals daily, less physical activity, more tech device time, not monitoring calories, and 
using public transportation were all associated with a higher likelihood of obesity.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

Based on the findings of this analysis, the following recommendations can be made to address and prevent obesity levels:

Promote healthy eating habits: Encouraging individuals to consume more vegetables, have regular main meals daily, and avoid high-caloric foods can help in maintaining a healthy weight.

Increase physical activity: Encouraging individuals to engage in regular physical activity can help in reducing the risk of obesity and promoting overall health.

Monitor weight and calorie intake: Individuals should be encouraged to monitor their weight and calories to ensure they are maintaining a healthy weight and diet.

Promote active transportation: Encouraging individuals to use active modes of transportation such as walking or cycling can help in increasing physical activity levels and reducing the risk of obesity.

Raise awareness: Public health campaigns and education programs should be implemented to raise awareness about the risks of obesity and the importance of healthy lifestyle choices.

Personalized interventions: Healthcare providers should consider individual differences in lifestyle factors when designing personalized treatment plans for obesity prevention and management.

Overall, the development of a predictive classification model for obesity levels based on lifestyle factors has the potential to significantly impact public health outcomes by identifying individuals at 
risk of obesity and implementing targeted interventions for prevention and treatment. By addressing key lifestyle factors associated with obesity, we can work towards reducing the prevalence of 
obesity and its related health complications.
