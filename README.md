The business problem for this analysis could be developing a prediction model to identify individuals at risk of obesity based on their 
characteristics and behaviors. This could be useful for healthcare providers, insurers, and public health organizations to target 
interventions and support for individuals who are likely to develop obesity or are already overweight. By predicting obesity levels, healthcare 
providers can offer personalized treatment plans and interventions to prevent or manage obesity-related health issues. Insurers can use this 
information to offer tailored wellness programs and incentives to encourage healthy behaviors. Public health organizations can use this data to 
understand trends in obesity and develop targeted interventions to address the problem at a population level. 
Ultimately, the goal of this analysis would be to improve individual health outcomes and reduce the overall burden of obesity on society.

Questions for this analysis:
1.Can we predict the likelihood of obesity based on variables such as family history with overweight, high caloric food consumption, and 
physical activity level?
2. How does gender impact obesity levels in individuals?
3. Are there any relationships between eating habits (such as main meals daily, vegetable consumption, and snacking between meals) and obesity levels?
4. Can we classify individuals into different obesity levels based on their demographic and lifestyle factors?
5.Is there a correlation between alcohol consumption and obesity levels?
6.How do factors like smoking, daily water intake, and use of tech devices impact obesity levels?
7.Can we predict the risk of obesity based on a combination of variables such as transportation mode used, monitor calories, and physical activity 
level?*/
